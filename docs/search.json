    "text": "What can I find in this geom encyclopedia?\nLet’s begin by looking at what we mean by geom in data visualization. In this context, geoms (short for geometries in ggplot2 package) are the visual elements used to represent data in a plot. They define the type of chart such as point chart, line chart, bar chart, etc.\nTo illustrate the idea I use the following dataset which contains information related to 82 countires. The variable description is as follows (Table 1):\nTable 1: Variable Description\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCountry name\n\n\nIncome\nIncome category in 2021: lower income (L), lower middle income (LM)\n\n\nElectricity\nPercentage of people access to electricity\nThe first eight rows of the dataset as well as the R code to load the dataset is given below:\nlibrary(drone)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata(\"worldbankdata\")\nworldbankdata2021 &lt;- worldbankdata |&gt; filter(Year == 2021) |&gt;\n  filter( Income == \"LM\" | Income ==\"L\") |&gt; \n  select( Country, Income, Electricity)\nworldbankdata2021 |&gt; head(8)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  Country      Income Electricity\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  L             97.7\n2 Angola       LM            48.2\n3 Burundi      L             10.2\n4 Benin        LM            42.0\n5 Burkina Faso L             19.0\n6 Bangladesh   LM            99.0\n7 Bolivia      LM            98.6\n8 Bhutan       LM           100\nNow, I want to visualize the relationship between Electricity and Income variables on the cartesian coordinate plane shown in Figure 1\nFigure 1: Cartesian coordinate plane showing Income (x-axis) and Electricity (y-axis).\nFigure 2 shows 6 plotting types that I created to visualise the relationship between the variables Electricity and Income on the Cartesian plane Figure 1.\nFigure 2: Six plot types used to visualize the relationship between income level (low income [L], lower-middle income [LM]) and the percentage of people with access to electricity in 2021.\nIn all panels of Figure 2 (a–h), the same dataset, variables, and Cartesian coordinate system are used. However, the chart types different.\nCould you list the differences you observe in the charts?\nWhen creating a chart, we first decide on the statistic we want to visualize. Next, we compute this statistic from the data, and finally, we use a suitable geometry to display the computed values of the statistic. Table 2 summarizes the statistical operations (or statistical transformations) performed on the data and the corresponding geometries used to visualize the computed statistics.\nTable 2: Statistical transformations and geom/stat layers are used in the plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlot\nStatistical Operation\nVisualisation Method\ngeom layer\nstat layer\n\n\n\n\nA\nUse individual data points\nPoint geometry\npoint\ndata is plotted as-is\n\n\nB\nUse individual data points\nQuasirandom geometry\nquasirandom\ndata is plotted as-is.

    "text": "What you will learn?\nIn this geom encyclopedia you will learn different types of geoms and their applications. Furthermore, each geom has a set of aesthetics that it understands. These aesthetics can be divided into two parts: i) required aesthetics and ii) optional aesthetics. Further, every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom.\nTo give you an idea about the associated aesthetics and stat, let’s look at the plot shown in Figure 3. In this case x, y are required aesthetics and color size and alpha is optional aesthetics. The statistics layer is identity since the data points are plotted as it is.\nThe aesthetic mappings, defined with aes(), describe how variables in the dataset are mapped to aesthetics (or visual properties of the plot). This aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income) is called mapping variables to the visual properties of the chart. This alpha=0.5, size=2 is called setting values to visual properties.\n\nggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distribution of Electricity by Income Category\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this geom encyclopedia, you will also learn about the required and optional aesthetics that each geom supports. Additionally, an example is provided demonstrating the application of each geom with reproducible R code.\nIn summary you will learn:\n\nWhat each geom does The purpose of different geoms (e.g., points, lines, bars, boxes, tiles) and the types of data and questions they are best suited for.\nRequired and optional aesthetics Which aesthetics (such as x, y, colour, fill, size, group) are required for each geom and how optional aesthetics change the appearance and meaning of a plot.\nTypical use cases When to use each geom—for example, comparing distributions, showing relationships, visualizing trends over time, or displaying uncertainty.\nCommon variations and set parameters Key arguments (such as stat, position, alpha, width, binwidth) and how they affect the visual output.\nStrategies to improve clarity of plots Strategies to overcome the frequent challenges such as overplapping, missing values, highlight trend, etc.\nConnections between geoms and statistics How geoms interact with statistical transformations (e.g., geom_histogram() with binning, geom_smooth() with model fitting).\n\nvii.
