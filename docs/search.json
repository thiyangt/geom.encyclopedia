    "text": "What can I find in this geom encyclopedia?\nLet’s begin by looking at what we mean by geom in data visualization. In this context, geoms (short for geometries in ggplot2 package) are the visual elements used to represent data in a plot. They define the type of chart such as point chart, line chart, bar chart, etc.\nTo illustrate the idea I use the following dataset which contains information related to 82 countires. The variable description is as follows:\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCountry name\n\n\nIncome\nIncome category in 2021: lower income (L), lower middle income (LM)\n\n\nElectricity\nPercentage of people access to electricity\nThe first eight rows of the dataset as well as the R code to load the dataset is given below:\nlibrary(drone)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata(\"worldbankdata\")\nworldbankdata2021 &lt;- worldbankdata |&gt; filter(Year == 2021) |&gt;\n  filter( Income == \"LM\" | Income ==\"L\") |&gt; \n  select( Country, Income, Electricity)\nworldbankdata2021 |&gt; head(8)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  Country      Income Electricity\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  L             97.7\n2 Angola       LM            48.2\n3 Burundi      L             10.2\n4 Benin        LM            42.0\n5 Burkina Faso L             19.0\n6 Bangladesh   LM            99.0\n7 Bolivia      LM            98.6\n8 Bhutan       LM           100\nNow, I want to visualize the relationship between Electricity and Income variables on the cartesian coordinate plane shown in Figure @ref(fig:cartesian)\nFigure 1: Cartesian Coordinate Plane. Income level is mapped to x-axis and Electricity is mapped to y-axis.\nFigure 2 shows 6 plotting types that I created using the same dataset and same cartesian plane.\nFigure 2: Relationship between income level and percentage of people access to electricity in lower incom (L), lower middle income (LM) in 2021\nIn all the charts shown in Figure 2, I used the same dataset, the same variables, and the same Cartesian plane. However, the chart types different.\nCould you list the differences you observe in the charts?\nWhen creating a chart, we first decide on the statistic we want to visualize. Next, we compute this statistic from the data, and finally, we use a suitable geometry to display the computed values. Table 2 summarizes the statistical operations performed on the data and the corresponding geometries used to visualize the computed statistics.\nlibrary(knitr)\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  Code = c(\"A\", \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", \"G\", \"H\"),\n  `Statistical Operation` = c(\n    \"Use individual data points\",\n    \"Use individual data points\",\n    \"Use individual data points\",\n    \"Compute quartiles, Q1 − 3·IQR, and Q3 + 3·IQR\",\n    \"Use individual data points; compute quartiles, Q1 − 3·IQR, and Q3 + 3·IQR\",\n    \"Compute kernel density\",\n    \"Compute minimum and maximum of data\",\n    \"Compute minimum, mean, and maximum\"\n  ),\n  `Visualization Method` = c(\n    \"Point geometry\",\n    \"Quasirandom geometry\",\n    \"Jitter geometry\",\n    \"Box-and-whisker plot\",\n    \"Jitter geometry and box-and-whisker plot\",\n    \"Violin geometry\",\n    \"Line geometry\",\n    \"Line geometry (range) and point geometry (mean)\"\n  )\n)\n\ndata |&gt;    kbl(col.names = c(\"Plot\", \"Statistical Operation\", \"Visualisation Method\")) |&gt; \n  kable_paper(\"hover\", full_width = F)\n\n\n\n\nPlot\nStatistical Operation\nVisualisation Method\n\n\n\n\nA\nUse individual data points\nPoint geometry\n\n\nB\nUse individual data points\nQuasirandom geometry\n\n\nC\nUse individual data points\nJitter geometry\n\n\nD\nCompute quartiles, Q1 − 3·IQR, and Q3 + 3·IQR\nBox-and-whisker plot\n\n\nE\nUse individual data points; compute quartiles, Q1 − 3·IQR, and Q3 + 3·IQR\nJitter geometry and box-and-whisker plot\n\n\nF\nCompute kernel density\nViolin geometry\n\n\nG\nCompute minimum and maximum of data\nLine geometry\n\n\nH\nCompute minimum, mean, and maximum\nLine geometry (range) and point geometry (mean)\nHere is a summary of geom and stat layers used in the charts shown in Figure @ref(fig:geom).\nPlot\ngeom layer\nstat layer\n\n\n\n\nA\npoint\ndata is plotted as-is\n\n\nB\nquasirandom\ndata is plotted as-is.

    "text": "What you will learn?\nEach geom has a set of aesthetics that it understands. These aesthetics can be divided into two parts: i) required aesthetics and ii) optional aesthetics. Further, Every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom.\nTo get an idea about the associated aesthetics and stat let look at plot shown in Figure 4. In this case x, y are required aesthetics and color size and alpha is optional aesthetics. The statistics layer is identity since the data points are plotted as it is.\nThe aesthetic mappings, defined with aes(), describe how variables in the dataset are mapped to visual properties or aesthetics. This aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income) is called mapping variables to the visual properties of the chart. This alpha=0.5, size=2 is called setting values to visual properties.\n\nggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of Electricity by Income Category\n\n\n\n\nIn this geom encyclopedia, you will learn about the required and optional aesthetics that each geom supports, as well as the associated statistical layer for each geom.
