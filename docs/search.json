    "text": "What can I find in this geom encyclopedia?\nBefore answering this question let me briefly explain what is data visualisation? Data visualization is the graphical representation of data to understand the patterns, trends, relationships, outliers and complex structures hidden inside data more easily.\nNow let’s look at what is geom?\nIn data visualization, geometries (or geoms) refer to the visual elements that represent data in a plot. They define the type of chart or shape used to depict data points or relationships.\nTo illustrate the idea I use the following dataset which contains information related to 82 countires. The variable description is as follows:\nVariable\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nCountry\nCountry name\n\n\nIncome\nIncome category in 2021: lower income (L), lower middle income (LM)\n\n\nElectricity\nPercentage of people access to electricity\nThe first eight rows of the dataset as well as the R code to load the dataset is given below:\nlibrary(drone)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\ndata(\"worldbankdata\")\nworldbankdata2021 &lt;- worldbankdata |&gt; filter(Year == 2021) |&gt;\n  filter( Income == \"LM\" | Income ==\"L\") |&gt; \n  select( Country, Income, Electricity)\nworldbankdata2021 |&gt; head(8)\n\n# A tibble: 8 × 3\n  Country      Income Electricity\n  &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;fct&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Afghanistan  L             97.7\n2 Angola       LM            48.2\n3 Burundi      L             10.2\n4 Benin        LM            42.0\n5 Burkina Faso L             19.0\n6 Bangladesh   LM            99.0\n7 Bolivia      LM            98.6\n8 Bhutan       LM           100\nNow, I want to visualize the relationship between Electricity and Income variables on the cartesian coordinate plane shown in Figure @ref(fig:cartesian)\nFigure 1: Cartesian Coordinate Plane. Income level is mapped to x-axis and Electricity is mapped to y-axis.\nFigure 2 shows 6 plotting types that I created using the same dataset and same cartesian plane.\nFigure 2: Relationship between income level and percentage of people access to electricity in lower incom (L), lower middle income (LM) in 2021\nEven though, I used the same data set and same Cartesian coordinate plane the appearance of the plots are drastically different.\nCould you list the differences you observe in the charts?\nHere is a summary of geom and stat layers used in the charts shown in Figure @ref(fig:geom).\nPlot\ngeom layer\nstat layer\n\n\n\n\nA\npoint\ndata is plotted as-is\n\n\nB\nquasirandom\ndata is plotted as-is. But, generate quasirandom placement of points, helpful for avoiding overplotting\n\n\nC\njitter\ndata is plotted as-is. But, adds a small amount of random noise to the position of points to reduce overlap and make individual points more visible\n\n\nD\nboxplot\nFive statistical summary measures used in the boxplot\n\n\nE\njitter and boxplot\nIndividual points and summary measures corresponds to boxplot\n\n\nF\nviolin\ncalculate and plot the kernel density estimation (KDE) for continuous data\n\n\nG\nlinerange\nRange of data\n\n\nH\nlinerange and point\nRange and mean of data\nThis encylopedia is a collection of geoms, in other words plot types that you can create using the ggplot2 or extensions of ggplot2 framework. In other words Encyclopedia of Plots.",

    "text": "What you will learn?\nEach geom has a set of aesthetics that it understands. These aesthetics can be divided into two parts: i) required aesthetics and ii) optional aesthetics. Further, Every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom.\nTo get an idea about the associated aesthetics and stat let look at plot shown in Figure 4. In this case x, y are required aesthetics and color size and alpha is optional aesthetics. The statistics layer is identity since the data points are plotted as it is.\nThe aesthetic mappings, defined with aes(), describe how variables in the dataset are mapped to visual properties or aesthetics. This aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income) is called mapping variables to the visual properties of the chart. This alpha=0.5, size=2 is called setting values to visual properties.\n\nggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income)) + \n  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2) +\n  scale_color_brewer(palette = \"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Distribution of Electricity by Income Category\n\n\n\n\nIn this geom encyclopedia, you will learn about the required and optional aesthetics that each geom supports, as well as the associated statistical layer for each geom. Additionally, an example is provided demonstrating the application of each geom with reproducible R code.",
