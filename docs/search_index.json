For example, number of cases or user defined number. Statistics layer(s): stat_count - This the default statistics layer. It counts number of cases in each group. stat_identify - It plots the data as it is. See also: geom_col 6.1.1 With count ggplot(elephants, aes(y = Age_Category)) + geom_bar() Figure 6.1: Illustration of geom_bar to create a bar chart ggplot(elephants, aes(y = Age_Category, fill=Category)) + geom_bar() Figure 6.2: Illustration of geom_bar to create a stacked bar chart ggplot(elephants, aes(y=Age_Category, fill = Category)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Figure 6.3: Illustration of geom_bar to create a cluster bar chart ggplot(elephants, aes(y=Age_Category, fill = Category)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) Figure 6.4: Illustration of geom_bar to create a cluster bar chart 6.1.2 With identity dfbar &lt;- data.frame(class=c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;), income = c(100, 200)) ggplot(dfbar, aes(class, income)) + geom_bar(stat=&quot;identity&quot;) 6.2 geom_bin_2d Package: ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2023) Description: Divides the Cartesian plane created by x-variable and y-variable into rectangles (2D histogram), counts the number of observations in each rectangle. Only the observations with rectangles are filled according to the number ofobservations. Understandable aesthetics: x, y, fill, group Statistics layer(s): See also: geom_bin2d, geom_point ggplot(elephants.subset.100, aes(y = Height, x=Fore_Feet_Circumference)) + geom_bin_2d() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) Figure 6.5: Illustration of using geom_bin_2d ggplot(elephants.subset.100, aes(y = Height, x=Fore_Feet_Circumference)) + geom_bin_2d(bins=20) + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) Figure 6.6: Illustration of changing bins in geom_bin_2d 6.3 geom_bin2d_pattern Package: ggpattern (FC, Davis, and ggplot2 authors 2022) Description: Divides the Cartesian plane created by x-variable and y-variable into rectangles (2D-Histogram), counts the number of observations in each rectangle. Only the observations with rectangles are filled with a pattern. Understandable aesthetics: pattern_fill (pattern_* - for mapping variables under aesthetics), pattern (to set a patten, for example pattern=‘stripe’), fill, colour Statistics layer(s): See also: geom_bin2d, geom_point ggplot(elephants.subset.100, aes(y = Height, x=Fore_Feet_Circumference)) + ggpattern::geom_bin2d_pattern(bins=5) + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) Figure 6.7: Illustration of using geom_bin_2d 6.4 geom_bin2d Package: ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2023) Description: Divides the Cartesian plane created by x-variable and y-variable into rectangles, counts the number of observations in each rectangle. Only the observations with rectangles are filled according to the number ofobservations. Understandable aesthetics: x, y, fill, group Statistics layer(s): See also: geom_bin_2d, geom_point Example: ggplot(elephants.subset.100, aes(y = Height, x=Fore_Feet_Circumference)) + geom_bin2d() + theme(aspect.ratio = 1) Figure 6.8: Illustration of using geom_bin_2d 6.5 geom_blank Package: ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2023) Description: Draws nothing. 6.6 geom_boxplot Package: ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2023) Description: Draw a bar proportional to the specified number. For example, number of cases or user defined number. Statistics layer(s): stat_boxplot - This the default statistics layer. This computes minimum, maximum, median, first quartile (\\(Q1\\)), third quartile (\\(Q3\\)), upper whisker extends up to \\(Q3 + 1.5 \\times IQR\\) and lower whisker extends up to \\(Q1 - 1.5 \\times IQR\\), where \\(IQR = Q3 - Q1\\). In a notched box plot, it creates 95% confidence interval for mean.
