Welcome to the "Data Visualisation `geom` Encyclopedia", an encyclopedia of geometrics in Data Visualisation. Geometric representations serve as the visual language that bridges the gap between complex datasets and human comprehension. This encyclopedia is a curated collection of `geom` available in different R programming software packages.

The field of data visualization is dynamic, and new techniques and visualizations may emerge over time. Hence, I will be regularly updating this encyclopedia to ensure it remains a relevant and comprehensive resource for users.


This book is a work in progress. The accompanying package for drone is available at: https://github.com/thiyangt/drone
