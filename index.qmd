# Preface {.unnumbered}

Welcome to the "Data Visualisation `geom` Encyclopedia", an encyclopedia of geometrics in Data Visualisation. Geometric representations serve as the visual language that bridges the gap between complex datasets and human comprehension. This encyclopedia is a curated collection of `geom` available in different R programming software packages.

Keep in mind that the field of data visualization is dynamic, and new techniques and visualizations may emerge over time. Regularly updating your encyclopedia will ensure it remains a relevant and comprehensive resource for users.
