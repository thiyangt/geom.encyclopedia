# Preface {.unnumbered}

## What can I find in this <span style='color:red;'>geom encyclopedia</span>?

Let’s begin by looking at what we mean by geom in data visualization.
In this context, geoms (short for geometries in ggplot2 package) are the visual elements used to represent data in a plot. They define the type of chart such as point chart, line chart, bar chart, etc.

To illustrate the idea I use the following dataset which contains information related to 82 countires. The variable description is as follows:

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
Variable <- c("Country", "Income", "Electricity")
description <- c("Country name", "Income category in 2021: lower income (L), lower middle income (LM)", "Percentage of people access to electricity")
df <- data.frame(Variable, Description = description)
df |> kbl() |>
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)
```

The first eight rows of the dataset as well as the R code to load the dataset is given below:

```{r,  warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(drone)
library(tidyverse)
data("worldbankdata")
worldbankdata2021 <- worldbankdata |> filter(Year == 2021) |>
  filter( Income == "LM" | Income =="L") |> 
  select( Country, Income, Electricity)
worldbankdata2021 |> head(8)
```


Now, I want to visualize the relationship between Electricity and Income variables on the cartesian coordinate plane shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cartesian)

```{r, fig.height=3, fig.width=3,echo=FALSE}
#| fig.cap: "Figure 1: Cartesian Coordinate Plane. Income level is mapped to x-axis and Electricity is mapped to y-axis."
#| fig.label: "fig:cartesian"
p0 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity))
p0
```

Figure 2 shows 6 plotting types that I created using the same dataset and same cartesian plane. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, fig.width=8, fig.height=15, echo=FALSE}
#| fig.cap: "Figure 2: Relationship between income level and percentage of people access to electricity in lower incom (L), lower middle income (LM) in 2021"
#| fig.label: "fig:geom"
library(patchwork)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggbeeswarm)
library(ggplot2)
library(drone)
data("worldbankdata")
worldbankdata2021 <- worldbankdata |> filter(Year == 2021 & Income == "LM" | Income =="L")

p1 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity)) + geom_point() + ggtitle("A: geom_point")
p2 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity)) + geom_quasirandom() + ggtitle("B: geom_quasirandom")
p3 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity)) + geom_jitter() + ggtitle("C: geom_jitter")
p4 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity)) + geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("D: geom_boxplot")
p5 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity)) + geom_jitter() + geom_boxplot(alpha=0.5, outlier.shape = NA) + ggtitle("E: geom_jitter and geom_boxplot")
p6 <- ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity)) + geom_violin(width = 1, fill="white", trim=TRUE)+ ggtitle("F: geom_violin")

lrdf <- worldbankdata2021 |> select(Electricity, Income) |> group_by(Income) |>
  summarize(Min = min(Electricity, na.rm = TRUE), Max = max(Electricity, na.rm=TRUE), Mean = mean(Electricity, na.rm = TRUE))
p7 <- ggplot(lrdf) + 
   geom_linerange(aes(x=Income, ymin=Min, ymax=Max, ymean = Mean), width=0.2, size=1, color="blue") + ggtitle("G: geom_linerange") + ylab("Electricity")
p8 <- ggplot(lrdf) + 
   geom_linerange(aes(x=Income, ymin=Min, ymax=Max),  width=0.2, size=1, color="blue") + 
  geom_point( aes(x=Income, y=Mean), col="white", size=4, shape=21, fill="red") + ggtitle("H: geom_linerage and geom_point") + ylab("Electricity")

(p1 | p2) / ( p3 | p4) / (p5 | p6 ) / (p7 | p8)
```

In all the charts shown in Figure 2 a-h, I used the same dataset, the same variables, and the same Cartesian plane. However, the chart types different.

Could you list the differences you observe in the charts?

1. The type of chart or shape used to depict data.

2. The statistics that we compute on the data to visualize on the chart. 

When creating a chart, we first decide on the statistic we want to visualize. Next, we compute this statistic from the data, and finally, we use a suitable geometry to display the computed values. Table 2 summarizes the statistical operations performed on the data and the corresponding geometries used to visualize the computed statistics.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(knitr)

data <- data.frame(
  Code = c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H"),
  `Statistical Operation` = c(
    "Use individual data points",
    "Use individual data points",
    "Use individual data points",
    "Compute quartiles, Q1 − 3·IQR, and Q3 + 3·IQR",
    "Use individual data points; compute quartiles, Q1 − 3·IQR, and Q3 + 3·IQR",
    "Compute kernel density",
    "Compute minimum and maximum of data",
    "Compute minimum, mean, and maximum"
  ),
  `Visualization Method` = c(
    "Point geometry",
    "Quasirandom geometry",
    "Jitter geometry",
    "Box-and-whisker plot",
    "Jitter geometry and box-and-whisker plot",
    "Violin geometry",
    "Line geometry",
    "Line geometry (range) and point geometry (mean)"
  ),
  `geom layer` <- c("point",
          "quasirandom",
          "jitter",
          "boxplot",
          "jitter and boxplot",
          "violin",
          "linerange",
          "linerange and point"),
  `stat layer` <- c("data is plotted as-is", 
          "data is plotted as-is. But, generate quasirandom placement of points, helpful for avoiding overplotting",
          "data is plotted as-is. But, adds a small amount of random noise to the position of points to reduce overlap and make individual points more visible",
          "Five statistical summary measures used in the boxplot",
          "Individual points and summary measures corresponds to boxplot",
          " calculate and plot the kernel density estimate(KDE) for continuous data",
          "Range of data",
          "Range and mean of data")
  
)

data |>    kbl(col.names = c("Plot", "Statistical Operation", "Visualisation Method", "geom layer", "stat layer")) |> 
  kable_paper("hover", full_width = F)

```



This encyclopedia is a collection of geoms, in other words plot types that you can create using the ggplot2 or extensions of ggplot2 under the grammar of graphics framework. In other words <span style='color:red;'>Encyclopedia of Plots</span>.

## Motivation to write this book

The motivation behind writing this encyclopedia is, there is no centralized resource where all geoms can be viewed in one place. Additionally, no comprehensive book exists that catalogs the different types of plots available for data visualization. Having them in one place help data visualizers to craft more effective analyses and create new geoms. Further, this also helps to avoid duplicate efforts.

## What you will learn?


Each geom has a set of aesthetics that it understands. These aesthetics can be divided into two parts: i) required aesthetics and ii) optional aesthetics. Further, Every geom has a default stat; and every stat has a default geom.

To get an idea about the associated aesthetics and stat let look at plot shown in Figure 4. In this case `x`, `y` are required aesthetics and `color` `size` and `alpha` is optional aesthetics. The statistics layer is identity since the data points are plotted as it is. 

The aesthetic mappings, defined with `aes()`, describe how variables in the dataset are mapped to visual properties or aesthetics. This `aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income)` is called mapping variables to the visual properties of the chart. This `alpha=0.5, size=2` is called setting values to visual properties. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
#| fig.cap: "Figure 4: Distribution of Electricity by Income Category "
#| fig.label: "fig:example"
ggplot(worldbankdata2021, aes(x=Income, y=Electricity, color=Income)) + 
  geom_point(alpha=0.5, size=2) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Dark2")
```

In this <span style='color:red;'>geom encyclopedia</span>, you will learn about the required and optional aesthetics that each geom supports, as well as the associated statistical layer for each geom. Additionally, an example is provided demonstrating the application of each geom with reproducible R code.

## What you won't learn?

This book is not focused on teaching R programming fundamentals or providing a comprehensive guide to data visualization principles. It assumes you already have a basic understanding of R and ggplot2, and it will not cover how to start from scratch in these areas.

## How this <span style='color:red;'>geom encyclopedia</span> is organized?

As this is an encyclopedia, the chapters are organised according to the alphabetical order. However, within a chapter geoms are not organized according to the alphabetical order. At the beginning of each chapter, I have tabulated the geoms listed under that letter.

## Audience

The Figure 3 shows my target audience for the book. In general for all data enthusiasts, this can be considered as a <span style='color:green;'>Encyclopedia of Plots</span>. For R, tidyverse, gggplot2 users this can be considered as a <span style='color:red;'>Data Visualisation Geometries Encyclopedia</span>.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
#| fig.cap: "Figure 4: Audience"
#| fig.label: "fig:audience"
knitr::include_graphics("audience.png")
```
